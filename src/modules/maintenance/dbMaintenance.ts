/**
 * modules/maintenance/dbMaintenance.ts
 *
 * Keeps bot.db small over time. Two jobs, run together daily (see
 * handlers/schedulers.ts → startDbMaintenanceScheduler):
 *
 *   pruneOldData() — deletes rows from tables that are deliberately
 *   log/transient in nature (not real config or history a server owner
 *   would want kept — these are the exact same tables already excluded
 *   from /backup snapshots, see modules/backup/service.ts for why each one
 *   is considered "safe to lose").
 *
 *   vacuumDatabase() — SQLite doesn't shrink the file automatically after
 *   deletes (freed pages just get reused internally). VACUUM rewrites the
 *   file without the free pages, which is what actually reduces bot.db's
 *   size on disk (and therefore what gets pushed to GitHub via dbSync.ts).
 *
 * Retention windows are intentionally short for these tables — they're all
 * either test/simulation artifacts or rolling activity logs, not anything
 * a server owner would need to look back further than this on.
