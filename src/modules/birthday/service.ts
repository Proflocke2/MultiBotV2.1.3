/**
 * modules/birthday/service.ts
 *
 * Public entry point — runBirthdayTick(guilds) gets called once from a
 * scheduler (handlers/schedulers.ts, every 15-30 min, see startBirthdayScheduler).
 *
 * Does two things per active guild, every tick:
 *   1. Removes birthday_role from anyone who still has it but wasn't
 *      greeted TODAY — i.e. it's left over from a previous day. This
 *      doubles as the "take the role away the next day" cleanup, so no
 *      separate job is needed (this is a deliberate simplification — see
 *      the caveat comment further down about what it means for manually
 *      assigned copies of that role).
 *   2. Greets today's birthdays once the configured hour has passed.
