/**
 * /security — merged command.
 *   antinuke        ← former /antinuke        (subcommand group)
 *   antiraid        ← former /antiraid        (subcommand group)
 *   auto-defend     ← former /auto-defend     (subcommand group)
 *   ultra-mode      ← former /ultra-mode      (subcommand group)
 *   inactivity-kick ← former /inactivitykick  (subcommand group)
 *   config          ← former /security-config (plain subcommand)
 *
 * All original logic is untouched; this only re-exposes it under one
 * top-level command so the six former commands no longer eat into
 * Discord's 100-command limit individually.
