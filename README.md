## Features

### 🎫 Ticket System
A full support-ticket system with panels and multi-panels. Members open a ticket
with one click, staff get a private channel, and everything is archived as a
transcript automatically.

- Multi-panel with up to 5 panels / 25 categories combined into one message
- Custom form questions per panel or per category, asked before a ticket opens
- Auto-close for inactive tickets, support-hour restrictions, sticky branding
- Transcript export (HTML/TXT), archive channel, exit survey (1-5 stars)
- Saved-response tags, reusable ticket-type templates, staff performance stats

### 🛡️ Moderation & AutoMod
A complete moderation toolkit with automatic escalation.

- Ban, kick, timeout, and warnings with configurable auto-escalation
- AutoMod: spam, bad words, invite links, phishing links, caps-lock, regex filters
- Mod-log for deleted/edited messages and member joins/leaves
- Channel lock/unlock, slowmode (server-wide or per-user), bulk message purge
- Mod notes and full infraction history per member

### 🛡️ Anti-Raid & Security
Layered protection against raids and compromised accounts, grouped under `/security`:

- **Anti-Nuke** — protects against a compromised staff account mass-deleting channels/roles
- **Anti-Raid** — detects join waves and reacts automatically
- **Auto-Defend** — the bot picks an automatic action per attack type
- **Ultra-Mode** — instant, score-based defense for suspicious new joiners
- **Inactivity-Kick** — removes members who never became active
- `/raid-tools` and `/attacksim` let you safely *test* your setup before you need it

### 🎭 Reaction & Button Roles
Self-assignable roles by clicking a button — no external bot needed.

### 📊 Level & XP System
Message-based XP with a cooldown, rank cards, a leaderboard, and role rewards
for reaching specific levels.

### 👋 Welcome System
Custom welcome cards (image, message, background), a private welcome DM, leave
messages, auto-roles, and alt-account detection. `/simwelcome` lets you preview
everything without a real member joining.

### 🪙 Economy & Casino
A virtual-coin system: slots, blackjack, a lottery, a shop, PvP coin duels, and
a mandatory disclaimer + cooldown before every gambling command.

### 🎮 Mini-Games
20+ games: Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect Four, Chess, Battleship, UNO, Yahtzee,
Mastermind, Hangman, Minesweeper, Wordle, trivia, party games, and more —
against the AI or against another player.

### 📝 Applications
A fully in-Discord application system (e.g. "apply for staff") — members
answer questions through modals, staff accept or decline with a reason.

### 👥 Staff Activity Tracking
Tracks how active your staff team is: closed tickets and registered giveaway
sponsors per member, a leaderboard, and an optional friendly weekly-goal
reminder. Everything is per-feature toggleable and disabled by default except
ticket counting.

### 🔧 Utility
Giveaways with auto-draw, polls, reminders, custom embeds, webhook management,
versioned server backups, live stats channels, per-server bot branding
(nickname/avatar/banner), and more.

## Commands

MultiBotV2 ships **83 top-level commands**. Many bundle several related
actions as subcommands (e.g. `/security antinuke setup`) to stay well under
Discord's 100-command limit while keeping the command surface organized.

For a full, plain-English explanation of every single command and
subcommand, run **`/help`** in Discord — it sends you a `.txt` guide written
at an easy reading level. A short table of the main categories:

| Category | Example commands |
|---|---|
| 🎫 Tickets | `/panel`, `/multipanel`, `/ticket`, `/ticket-types`, `/ticket-content`, `/settings`, `/ticketstats` |
| 🛡️ Moderation | `/member`, `/ban`, `/timeout`, `/warnings`, `/restrict`, `/mass-action`, `/records`, `/automod` |
| 🛡️ Security | `/security`, `/raid-tools`, `/attacksim` |
| 📊 Level & XP | `/level` |
| 👋 Welcome | `/welcome`, `/simwelcome` |
| 🪙 Economy | `/daily`, `/eco-stats`, `/pay`, `/shop`, `/blackjack`, `/slots`, `/eco-config`, `/eco-admin` |
| 🎮 Games | `/play`, `/challenge`, `/rps`, `/chess`, `/uno`, `/wordle`, `/quiz`, and 15+ more |
| 👥 Staff | `/team-activity` |
| 🔧 Utility | `/giveaway`, `/poll`, `/remind`, `/embed`, `/backup`, `/bot-customize`, `/stats`, `/webhook`, `/data`, `/help` |

---

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- **Node.js** v20 or higher
- A **Discord bot token** — [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- Gateway intents: `Guilds` · `GuildMembers` · `GuildMessages` · `MessageContent`

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Proflocke2/MultiDiscordBotV1.git
cd MultiDiscordBotV1

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Set environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# open .env and fill in BOT_TOKEN, CLIENT_ID, and (optionally) BOT_OWNER_ID

# 4. Development mode (hot-reload)
npm run dev

# 5. Production
npm run build
npm start
```

Slash commands are registered automatically on startup.

### Invite the bot

**[➜ Add the bot to your server](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1498679223223844977)**

---

## Configuration

### Environment variables

```env
BOT_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
CLIENT_ID=your_application_client_id
GUILD_ID=your_guild_id_here          # optional — instant per-guild command deploy
BOT_OWNER_ID=your_discord_user_id    # optional — grants owner-only access to /deploy
```

See `.env.example` for the full list, including the optional GitHub DB-backup
sync used on Render's free tier.

### Economy settings

Edit `src/economy/config/EconomyConfig.ts`:

```typescript
startingBalance:  1000,     // starting coins for new users
minBet:           1,        // minimum bet
maxBet:           Infinity, // maximum bet (set a number to cap it)
sessionLimit:     20,       // max games per 30 minutes
challengeTimeout: 60,       // seconds to accept a PvP challenge
```

### Staff Activity Tracking

Nothing to edit in code — everything is configured per server via
`/team-activity config-tickets`, `config-sponsors`, `config-leaderboard`, and
`config-quota`. See `/help` for details.

## Security

This bot has been through several security-hardening passes:

| Measure | Details |
|---|---|
| **SQL-injection protection** | `setGuildValue()` uses a column-name allowlist for every guild config write |
| **Runtime permission guards** | Admin commands check permissions server-side, not just via Discord's UI |
| **URL validation** | HTTPS-only, no local/private IPs (SSRF protection) |
| **GDPR compliance** | `/data info` / `/data delete` cover every table that stores personal data |
| **No error leaking** | Stack traces are logged internally, never shown to users |
| **Owner-gated destructive actions** | `/deploy` and other high-impact actions check `BOT_OWNER_ID` |

## Localization

Every bot message is fully translated, and every command's Discord-shown
description is localized too (the command name and default description
always stay in English). Server language is set with `/language`:

| Code | Language |
|---|---|
| `en` | 🇬🇧 English (default) |
| `de` | 🇩🇪 Deutsch |
| `fr` | 🇫🇷 Français |
| `ru` | 🇷🇺 Русский |
